This is a long shot but so was having Colin returned to us after I hung up “a missing person” sign years ago; so here it goes. Yesterday; Tuna’s airplane carrier went missing somewhere in LA! Haha. It was either left in Venice by Abbott Kinny near Lemonade; or outside of AA Terminal 4 (thankfully for us; sans Tuna.) It’s black; medium in size; and looks like a gym bag on wheels 👆. The @sherpabrand carrier is easily replaceable; but his blue EU Pet Passport that was inside the top pocket is very important and valuable. If you have seen this bags whereabouts; or if you can help me locate it from the LAX airport if you work there;" please email me at courtney@tunameltsmyheart.com! THANK U!""";13690821;1,72347E+18;;

I wasn’t going to post about it because it was kind of uneventful when it comes to celebrating. We spent it running all over Atlanta to make selections for our new house, we’re not feeling very well, and we spent hours in the airport to head back home. But as I sat on the tarmac waiting to take off, I was overwhelmed with gratitude. I looked over at my incredible husband who was holding our beautiful sleeping baby, and then I looked down at my feet and smiled at our amazing #toodlebrain sleeping in his airplane bag and I thought to myself, “WOW, the past two years have been SO eventful and I’m so grateful for every moment.” While there have been unforgettable moments and moments I wish I could forget, I realised that you have all been a part of our story and our journey. So I scrolled through our wedding photos as we flew over various states, and I selected some of the sweetest moments to share with you from that lovely day, just in case you missed this part ☺️ Ps: Yes Tuna was our ring bearer 🤣 Lovely photos by the amazing @agallant;13690821;1,92665E+18;;

I relied on trusty google, and @greendogdental came up with rave reviews (5 stars of 210 on Yelp!) Toons did excellent and his teeth look great! The cost is super affordable, the staff was beyond professional, and the environment they created to alleviate stress and anxiety for him was so intentional and thoughtful. They are AMAZING! HIGHLY recommended! Ps: Not an ad. Just excited and wanted to share. Go there if in LA. #teethcleaningfordogsissuperimportant!;13690821;1,71845E+18;;

This year’s word is Present. I find it hard to be present a lot of times because I’m distracted, and not just by life in general, but by other people’s lives via social media. I spend so many hours a day on it and not just because it’s my job, but because I’m intrigued and curious. Or bored. Or perhaps just nosey. Maybe all of the above. I love social media for the connection point, and I value the inclusiveness, but I recognise that my attachment to it has become grossly consuming on my end, so much so that I’m neglecting my own family to log in to know more about other people’s lives instead. So here is a picture of my family so you can see who I will be spending most of my time and attention on this year. Don’t worry- I’ll still be posting about Toons, I just need to limit how much time I spend on it personally. Happy New Year from our family to yours! Thank you for tracking with us all of these years! We are grateful for you all! Xx;13690821;1,94732E+18;;

She adored Tuna (as you can see) and he brought her so much joy, especially as she battled cancer. She also loved how much joy he brought all of you! She talked about it often. In honour of her, would you mind telling me in a comment how and/or why Tuna melts your heart? It can be simple or a testimony of something specific. I think reading what you say will be helpful for my heart today and throughout this holiday season. Loosing your parent sucks, especially over Christmas. I stand with you all who have experienced something similar. Love you all.;13690821;1,93362E+18;;

Please consider fostering and/or adopting! I was thinking of the importance of it last night and planned on posting about it today. Then, just now, I saw a post via @alextcooks about how LA shelters are overcrowded and hundreds of animals are in danger of being euthanised. This is not an isolated incident and happens all over the world. Please please PLEASE consider adopting as opposed to buying from a breeder. These sweet animals need a home, just like baby Tooney once did. #babytuna #adoptdontshop;13690821;1,83955E+18;;

In Sept of last year, she was diagnosed with cancer, and five months ago, today (12/13), I lost her to cancer complications. Five days before she passed, we found out that I was going to be a mom and we got to tell her that she’s going to be a grandma. What favour! What grace! Now it’s my turn to be an incredible mom, the way she was. I think both she and Tuna have prepared me for this new role, but man do I have big shoes to fill. Please pray for me, and please pray that Tuna likes this baby because he tends to have an aversion towards children. 😬😬😬 #bigbrother #mybump #dueinaugust #shrivelneck;13690821;1,77842E+18;;

We can either choose to use it as a platform to provoke fear, bullying and hate, or we can use it as a platform to promote peace, love, joy and hope. I'm not discounting disappointment, but I must say, that I am so encouraged by all of the accounts that are choosing to use it as the latter. No matter our differences of opinions, as a nation, it is important that we stand united and not divided. Do not be driven by fear and divided by hate. It is no use to partner with those things and it only worsens circumstances. So here is my best attempt at making you all smile and to encourage you that if you are being riddled with anxiety from accounts that are filling your minds with despair and fear, you've come to a place where you'll find none of that. #united 🇺🇸;13690821;1,38E+18;;

I changed his name to Mr. Burns after Montgomery Burns of the Simpsons per their uncanny resemblance. His nickname became Tooney, which is short for cartoon, and that morphed into Tuna, which stuck and is now his formal name. However, a lot of people think that his name is Phteven, after a meme of him with that name went viral. That being said, he goes by a lot of names and has a million more nicknames than I mentioned. Ps: His middle name is Marie. That's for another story.;13690821;1,50242E+18;;

So sorry I’ve been slower this week with posting. We closed on a house last Friday (which is really exciting!) and my husband and I have been tied up getting some things sorted at the house before we head back up to Cleveland to have our babe in 4 weeks from now. Can you guess where we are moving? It’s super hot and really green there.;13690821;1,83291E+18;;

This weekend we took an ""us"" trip to (amazing) Stockholm, and I stayed away purposefully from social media in order to be intentionally present with my husband. We left London the same morning of the tragic bombing at Parsons Green station, and I've been processing it ever since. When we found out, we were shocked because Parsons Green is the tube stop that we frequent often whilst in London, and it's the station directly across the street from the place where I met my husband 2.5 years ago, where he worked. It's also the place where we had our engagement drinks and where we celebrated our marriage (9 months later) with our London friends just a few weeks ago. It's very familiar, and hits close to home. The realisation that something like this could happen in quiet Parsons Green- can happen anywhere for that matter- just breaks my heart at how unpredictable life is. That's why I've been processing the importance of being present and not always distracted by my iPhone. I just needed a little break. Ps: I love you Londontown! You're my, and Tuna's second home. ❤️🇬🇧🙏 Pps: Can't wait to be back with my sweet baby Toons in 4 days!";13690821;1,60663E+18;;

I met Ruthie over a year ago when she, a completely trusting, and loving stranger, invited me to stay at her house for a full weekend because she was leaving town and I needed a place to stay with Tuna in Nashville. Fortunately we got a few precious hours together and I got to know her heart and hear her beautiful story over a bottle of wine :) Today she is sharing her story with the world, and I am the most excited about this because she's such a gift of a human, a total star, and an absolute legend...and I really want all of you to check out her story in her bio at @ruthielindsey! It's powerful, like she is, and I think it could be a HUGE encouragement for a lot of you. Ps: Check out that amazing, jovial smile of hers! That's her permanent face! For real.

Get creative with your posts and your captions. Tell your own rescue story or encourage people to rescue/adopt/foster/volunteer and/or donate money or supplies to a local shelter or one they already support. Also mention spay and neutering. Let’s use this platform to inform! We all have influence and this is important! Tag a shelter or rescue you support, and hashtag #supportrescuing and #adoptdontshop.

Well now you can thanks to @bykaraelise! She is Tuna's auntie, one of my best friends of life, an insane chef, and she is publishing a new AMAZING cookbook via @Kickstarter. She was also Tuna's ""tunager"" for almost 2 years, and played a HUGE, integral role in helping me with everything Tuna-related! When we were brainstorming Kickstarter rewards for her supporters, it was only natural to include Tuna in the mix. Since she's always championed us, we wanted to return the love to her! It's a big ticket item folks (and it all goes to publishing Kara's awesome new book, TOAST) but I promise it will be totally worth it! Lots of cuddles with Tuna and delicious food in your tummies! Only 2 spots available! Oh and there's a @darling dinner reward in there too :) Check out the details in the link in @bykaraelise's bio.";13690821;1,5677E+18;;

That may not be a big deal for some of you, but it actually makes me super sad. It also makes me sad for those who created some of the most hilarious videos in 6 seconds but no longer get to do that on that platform. That would be like finding out one day that there would be no more IG and I would have to start over on another social channel. #😩. While I wasn't a content creator on Vine, I checked it daily because the accounts I did follow brought me so much joy and laughter! One of those Vine creators happens to be one of my best friends, and Tuna's vet, @drtinaolivieri! Years ago she was going through a break-up and created a fun Vine series called #dairyofadumpedgirl. Tuna made a cameo in this clip and it's one of my favorite videos of him! Genius idea @drtinaolivieri! Lastly, I'm going to miss your hilarious antics @sunnymabrey, @arielle, @mattcutshall, @gabriel.gundacker, @mielmonster, @colesinstergerm, @regaljoe, @mikaelallong, among others.

That when I have a microwaveable-mindset and expect things to be ready or different in a minute's time instead of just marinating, and waiting for the right timing, I grow impatient and make decisions out of haste, and on impulse. I'm finding that there's beauty in process and I want to start appreciating it more and get better at being patient in the meantime.

Before Tuna, I knew nothing about fostering or rescuing. NOTHING! That's why I use his platform to raise awareness, and thank you for doing the same. You never know who you will impact and inspire. Rescue is so important because there are millions of dogs and cats that are homeless and being abused, neglected and euthanized 😩 Please foster, adopt or donate from your local shelter or sites like petfinder.com. And spread the word! Adopting Tuna was the best decision of my life and I can't imagine it without my tiny friend. Ps: His muscles 😭😭😭;13690821;1,34517E+18;;

This is the original Colin 👆. Four years ago today, I accidentally left him at a dog park, so I ordered Tuna a new Colin, but in a last ditch effort to find him, I posted this ""missing persons"" sign around the park, (and I also jumped into a dumpster to find him, to no avail 🙈.) Two days later, I was contacted by a woman who's dog retrieved him and took him back home with him. Thankfully, Colin was returned to us, but this event  started the trend of ordering loads of Colin's, which is why Tuna has six of him! Ps: This is not a joke 😭 Pps: Happy Fathers Day @monster_factory (⬅️colin)";13690821;1,27625E+18;;

Years before meeting Tuna; I used to say to God often;" """"I want to be used to change the world!"""" but I didn't know how"; or with what platform of influence. I certainly didn't think it would be through a little #shrivelneck dog. What I've come to find out is that I am by no means changing the world through Tuna's social platforms; but after receiving countless testimonies; it is apparent that we are being used as catalysts to change people's days....all over the world! That fact humbles me and makes me so proud to be this little ones momma;" and I can't stop and won't stop thanking God for hearing (and answering) my requests 😃 #HappyMothersDay (again) to every kind of momma!""";13690821;1,2459E+18;;;;;

Furthermore, I never would have thought that I actually enjoy giving his #shrivelneck what seems to be a million kisses throughout the day. And I certainly never would have imagined that there would be close to 2 million people who appreciated his #shrivelneck as much as I do! I am so humbled to be this one's momma, and I'm so grateful that I get to be a part of his story...and I'm even more humbled and grateful that he gets to be a part of some of yours! 😃 Thank you all for loving Tuna as much as I do! #HappyMothersDay to every kind of momma out there.;;;;

The calendar is available in the link in his bio or tunameltsmyheart.spreadshirt.com and it ships internationally! 😄 A huge thank you to @alissabell for the design, @s.dykert for the frame illustrations and all 12 #tunartuesdays artists! #hisface 😭😭😭;13690821;1,10669E+18;;

Stop by if you want to take a picture with him, or if you want to adopt an adorable dog or cat for yourself :) Tuna is asking that you bring dog or cat toys, sweaters, leashes, treats, food, etc for our annual Pet Toy Drive. Everything brought will be donated to benefit our furry friends at @bfas_la! #thankyouinadvance;13690821;8,75695E+17;;

A mask was required for admittance so Tuna asked @britt_adrift to make him a custom mask so that he could attend the soirée. He also asked me to get his tux dry cleaned, and he wanted a top hat and bow tie, naturally, but of course I forgot them at home, so #barkcam provided those.

We thought that was a BRILLIANT IDEA but it would be even better if it was a COLLABORATIVE EFFORT! Over the next 5 days, if everyone donated a dollar AND spread the word to your audiences to do the same, together, we could make a HUGE impact for the animal rescue community! While we would love to benefit every group in the universe that is helping animals in need, we chose to support 8 rescue groups that could use more awareness. Please visit, ruv.me/adollaradog for the ThanksGIVING campaign details, and to learn more about the 8 rescue groups we are supporting! *100% of all proceeds raised will be divided up to benefit the 8 rescue groups. #ADollarADog #PawItForward 💵🐶;13690821;8,60924E+17;;

Tuna's new buddy. #BarkPack is celebrating the release of Sony's @AnnieMovie coming out December 19th and came up with a brilliant idea to create awareness for rescue since the dog who plays Sandy in the movie is a rescue! If you post a photo of your pup wearing a red bow, hashtag #ImARescueToo, tell your story how your pup rescued you in the caption, and tag 3 friends to do the same, @BarkBox + Sony will donate $1 to the @ASPCA for each submission! Love that! So here's how Tuna rescued me: He helped redefine my purpose. What I mean by that is, I never expected any of this to happen. However, I love people & animals so much, so by having an outlet like @instagram, I am able to connect with all of you globally, and create awareness for animal rescue! Without Tuna, and without your love for him, none of this would be possible. I appreciate you all so much! 😘 Now keep spreading love and awareness for our furry friends in need!;13690821;8,57407E+17;;

You can easily become the catalyst to change the trajectory of a persons day by simply being kind to them. Start by smiling or by saying hello. Your kindness may be exactly what they need to feel loved and to be seen. Therefore, I charge you to start practicing kindness by being mindful with your words and intentional with your actions.

His middle name is Marie. I realize that's it's a female name and he's a male, but to be honest, I just really like how it sounds together. Also it's my mom's middle name, as well as my best friend's middle name, so it has sentimental meaning for me.

Ooou, I do!, and adopting him was one of THE BEST decisions I could have ever made because he has become the biggest joy in my life! Since October is adopt-a-shelter-dog month, you can either spread the word about the importance of adoption, or you can do something really fun and awesome...visit your local shelter and adopt a little buddy for yourself! Hooray! I bet there are a ton of shelters or private rescue groups all over your city. Just google it and you'll see 😘 #adoptioniskindofthebestidea;13690821;8,21836E+17;;

Adopting this little #toodlebrain was one of the best decisions I could have ever made, and as a result, he has become the biggest joy in my life! I encourage you all to consider adopting or fostering a animal in need of a home, because out of their gratitude for rescuing them, they will spoil you with endless love and affection! Just ask anyone who has ever adopted :) #SaveThemAll;13690821;7,79866E+17;;

I'm typically very specific about the type of the photographs I post of Tuna, namely, clarity is very important to me. However, every so often I capture a brilliant photo of Tuna flinching, and they typically turn out to be some of my most favorite photos of him. I've refrained from posting them in order to preserve the standard of quality I'd like to keep, but I'm throwing that out the window. I can no longer bear to laugh out loud by myself any longer. Therefore, I'm inviting you to accompany me in my joy. From now on, you will periodically see a new series of posts appropriately named: #blurrytuna. Cheers!;13690821;7,49442E+17;;

When you purchase a WagAware Charm at the meet up- the official symbol in support of dog rescue-, @wagaware will be donating 50% of the proceeds to benefit @bestfriendsanimalsociety! In return and as a HUGE ""thank you"", you will receive some cuddle time with Tuna & a few photos on your own camera :) If your furry friend already owns a charm, please bring it! So excited to be partnering with both of these pawesome organizations that are doing so much good for the animal community!

This photo was taken on that date;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;
My plans were only to foster a puppy; and the moment I laid eyes on Tuna; I knew he would be my guy. Unfortunately; our time together was cut short because I had previous plans to leave town; so I had to return him to his rescuer early. On my way out of town; I called to tell her that I had fallen in love with him; but I wasn't sure if I was ready to become a full-time dog parent. She told me that if the farmers market got rained out; I could take him for an additional week to make my decision. Well as fate would have it; it down poured on Dec 19th (3 years ago today;) so I was given another opportunity to foster him;" even though I knew that very day that he would be mine for keeps :) #hewasmeanttobemine #blessed""";13690821;6,14505E+17;

Some of you may know that he has two Colin's now because a few months ago I left the original one at the park so I immediately ordered him a new one. However, that next day, I posted a ""Have you seen this guy?"" sign in the park, and miraculously the original Colin was returned to us :) You can read more about that in a series of posts if you scroll through my feed and look for the ""missing persons"" sign of Colin.";;;;

1) What happened to Tuna's mouth?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A) Nothing happened :) He was just born with a recessed jawline/aggressive overbite. Plus 5 symmetrical facial moles with whiskers; a crumbled chin; and the most incredible #shrivelneck of all time!;;;;;;;;;;;
2) Does he have any complications eating?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A) None at all. He eats dry dog food intended for small breeds. #someoneisalittlepiggy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
3) What is his breed?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A) He's a Chiweenie. Half Chihuahua;" half Dachshund. Fully amazing! #tunameltsmyheart""";13690821;5,60374E+17;;;;;;;;;;

If you own a Tuna t-shirt, I thought that it would be really awesome if you wear it that day to celebrate him! Don't worry, I will remind you closer to the date :) If you don't have one and want one, the company is offering free/discounted standard shipping worldwide (up to $9.50) today thru Friday in honor of his upcoming birthday. Make sure to enter the promo code TUNABDAY at checkout. You can visit the link in his bio or tunameltsmyheart.spreadshirt.com to take a peek :) They also set up an (optional) EU site (look for the EU flag) for all of our friends over the pond. That way you will receive the shirts in time for his big day!;;;;

That became my mission :) A photo-a-day, and over a year later, I never would have anticipated or expected the kind of reaction that I've received. I am so encouraged by all of his followers who shower his page with love and affirmation. It really blesses me :) So I wanted to thank all of you for being so incredible, for your kind words and for loving Tuna so much! I also wanted to thank the folks at IG for allowing me the opportunity to make an impact on people's hearts from every continent. I am so grateful for that and for this wonderful community. #InstagramMeansToMe #tunameltsmyheart;13690821;4,01719E+17;;

I try my best to read all of them but sometimes I'm unaware if you left one on an older post. Additionally, I apologize that I'm not able to respond them all :( However, please be assured that your love for Tuna really really melts my heart!!! On another note, here's a question that I see a lot of: ""What is wrong with his face?"" Hilarious. So basically it's congenial, meaning he was born with a shorter lower jaw. NBD. It's just one of the many reasons why we all love him so much! Here's a close-up :) #tunameltsmyheart";13690821;3,4638E+17;;

I originally named him Mr. Burns, per the uncanny resemblance to Montgomery Burns, per the aggressive overbite and recessed lower jawline dysfunction (see his old tag above ^.) Shortly after I nicknamed him Tooney (short for cartoon) and then it morphed into Tuna, which is now his official name. #doppelgänger #tbt ;;;;

Rude. Breaks my little heart :( My theory is he was rejected because he has an aggressive, congenial lower jawline dysfunction which is unarguable his best feature :) I originally named him Mr. Burns (per the uncanny resemblance to Montgomery Burns...per the overbite) so organically I began to call him Tooney (short for cartoon) but that eventually turned into Tuna (which is now his official name :) His best friend is an emo alien doll named Colin and his other best friends are his cousin Ralph and his step brother Frankie. You'll be seeing more of them. Lastly but not leastly, Tuna is incredibly amazing, has the sweetest personality and is super lovable! I am so grateful that you all like him so much and I hope that he continues to bring everyone of you A TON of joy and laughter!!! Thanks for following!";13690821;2,08606E+17;;
